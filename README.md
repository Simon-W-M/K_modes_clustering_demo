# K_modes_clustering_demo
A quick and dirty demo of the k modes clustering method for categorical data

## Resources

Demo is linked to Coffee and Code session of 15 October 2025

Files include excel sheet that explains the intuition of the basic algorithim and a R script that uses synthethic data from kaggle to make some clusters.

Workflo includes downloading dataset from kaggle, basic EDA with GT summary, one hot encoding, hopkins statistic, a loop to run through various iterations to find appropriate level for K using elbow method and thenfinally clustering and applying to dataset and visualising.
